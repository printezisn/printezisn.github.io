        </p>
        <p>
          Both your nickname and score are stored in our Firebase Firestore
          database.
        </p>
        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>
          The information we collect is used for the following purposes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              To identify you in the game and display your nickname on the
              leaderboard.

          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not use this information for any other purposes, such as for
            advertising or data analysis.
          </p>
          <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
          <p>
            We store your information on Firebase Firestore, a secure cloud
            service provided by Google. We take reasonable steps to protect your
            information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.
            However, please note that no method of internet transmission is 100%
            secure, and while we strive to protect your data, we cannot
            guarantee its absolute security.
          </p>
          <h3>4. Firebase Firestore Data Storage</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to the data you provide (nickname and score), Firebase
            Firestore may automatically store certain metadata, such as:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Timestamps: Information about when your data (nickname and
                score) was created or last updated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transaction Metadata: Basic metadata related to the storage and
                retrieval of your data, such as document IDs or records of
                database transactions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            While Firebase Firestore does not collect personal information like
            your IP address or device details as part of our service, Google may
            collect such data as part of its network infrastructure for
            security, performance, and monitoring purposes. This data is used to
            maintain the service’s stability and security, and it is not shared
            with us. Firestore does not automatically collect or store sensitive
            personal information beyond the data you provide (nickname and
            score).
          </p>
          <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
          <p>
            We do not share your personal information (nickname or game score)
            with third parties, except in the following cases:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Service Providers: We may share your information with trusted
                third-party service providers, such as Firebase, who help us
                store and manage the data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Legal Compliance: We may disclose your information if required
                by law, to comply with legal obligations, or to protect the
                rights, property, or safety of Couples Run, its users, or
                others.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

                What We Collect from Children: We collect the player’s nickname
                and score to allow participation in the game’s leaderboard. We
                do not collect additional personal information from children.
              </li>
              <li>
